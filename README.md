# tinder-swipe-script
like everyone on tinder by simply downloading and running the [script](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/tinder-swipe-script/blob/master/TinderBot.scpt?raw=true).

# Speed
It likes 2 profiles every second (7200 likes each hour). You could change the delay between each swipe (to 0.1s) to achieve a swipe speed of 3 swipes per second (>10.000 swipes per hour).
Faster than this is impossible on my system because the profiles do not load any faster than that.

# Preconditions
- You must use a macOS system (It's written in Applescript)
- Use Safari (or change the script)
- You must be logged in on tinder.com

# Limitations
If you have a match, you'll have to manually click on 'keep swiping' to continue swiping
